# Chapter 8: Implementing Machine Learning to Generate Rap Instrumentals

Welcome back, dear reader, to the world of Python, where we create magic with code. In the previous chapter, we discussed several tips for improving music production workflow using Python. In this chapter, we take it up a notch and introduce you to the exciting world of machine learning and its significance in the world of music production.

Machine learning has disrupted almost every single industry, and music production is no exception. It has completely transformed the way music is composed, produced, and consumed. Today, we will explore how we can leverage machine learning to generate rap instrumentals. We will be using Python, Numpy, and PyTorch to implement this process.

Creating beat-free loops, developing drum patterns, and adding bass lines can be a challenging process. But with machine learning, we can train a model to generate music that fits our desired style and mood. In this chapter, we will look into how we can train our model, generate music, and fine-tune it to get the desired output.

Without further ado, let us dive right into the world of machine learning and explore how it can revolutionize rap instrumental making.
# Chapter 8: Implementing Machine Learning to Generate Rap Instrumentals

## The Mystery

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson sat in their living room, discussing their current case. Suddenly, they heard a knock on the door. Standing outside was a young rapper named Lil' J. He explained that he was in a tough spot - he needed a new instrumental for his upcoming album, but he was facing writer's block. He needed something fresh and unique to inspire him to write.

Sherlock had an idea. He had been introduced to machine learning recently and was curious about how it could be leveraged for music production. He suggested that they use machine learning to generate a rap instrumental for Lil' J.

Watson was skeptical. How could a machine create a piece of music that captures the essence of hip-hop and the unique voice of Lil' J? But Sherlock was confident that he could train a model that would generate a beat that would inspire Lil' J to write his new lyrics.

So, they started, with Sherlock taking on the task of training the machine learning model using PyTorch, Numpy, and Python for Lil' J's instrumentals. They used a dataset of hip-hop instrumentals and tweaked the model until they were satisfied with the output. However, the machine-generated instrumental that they received was not what Lil' J was looking for.

Sherlock was troubled. He had never failed a case before. How could he rectify the situation?

## The Resolution

After several sleepless nights, Sherlock realized that the machine learning model they had used was biased towards the dataset they had used to train it. He needed to tweak the model according to Lil' J's unique style of writing, so that the generated instrumental would be in line with Lil' J's style.

He spent hours analyzing Lil' J's previous work, studying his rhyming style and unique sound. Then he made small tweaks in the training data and parameters of the model. Voila! It worked!

The machine learning model generated an instrumental that captured the essence of Lil' J's style with a unique spin. Lil' J was ecstatic and inspired to write his next album.

Sherlock had done it again. He had leveraged his knowledge of machine learning and his attention to detail to solve a case - this time, in the world of music production. He had shown that even a machine can be customized to capture an artist's unique style and essence.

## The Code

To generate custom rap instrumentals using machine learning, we first need a dataset of instrumentals. We will use this dataset to train our model. In our case, Sherlock and Watson used an open-source dataset of hip-hop instrumentals. 

Next, we import the necessary libraries and packages to create, train, and evaluate the machine learning model. We use Python, Numpy, and PyTorch for this. PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework that is extensively used for creating neural networks.

```python
# Import necessary libraries

import numpy as np
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import torch.optim as optim
```

The next step is to create the neural network. We define the architecture of the neural network, including the number of layers, activation functions, and the optimizer function. We use the `nn.Module` class from PyTorch to create our neural network. 

```python
# Define neural network

class MusicGenerator(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self):
        super(MusicGenerator, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(100, 256)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 512)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(512, 1024)
        self.fc4 = nn.Linear(1024, 512)
        self.fc5 = nn.Linear(512, 256)
        self.fc6 = nn.Linear(256, 88)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc3(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc4(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc5(x))
        x = torch.sigmoid(self.fc6(x))
        return x
```

After creating the neural network, we train the model using the dataset. We divide the dataset into training and validation sets and use the `nn.MSELoss()` function to evaluate the loss. We use the `Adam` optimizer function to optimize the model parameters. 

```python
# Train neural network

def train(model, train_data, train_labels, optimizer, loss_fn, num_epochs):
    losses = []
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(train_data.float())
        loss = loss_fn(output, train_labels.float())
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        if epoch % 10 == 0:
            print("Epoch {}: Loss = {}".format(epoch, loss.item()))
        
        losses.append(loss.item())

    return model, losses

train_data, train_labels, activate_one_hot = prepare_data('music_dataset.csv')
model = MusicGenerator()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

model, losses = train(model, train_data, train_labels, optimizer, loss_fn, num_epochs=100)
```

Now that we have trained the model, we generate a new instrumental using random noise. We use our trained model to generate the instrumental. 

```python
# Generate new instrumental

def generate_instrumental(model, length=44000):
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        z = torch.randn(1, 100)
        instrumental = model(z)..numpy()
    return instrumental.flatten()[:length]
```

Finally, Sherlock tweaked the model to include Lil' J's unique style. He defined a custom loss function that considered not only the accuracy of the generated instrumental but also how closely it matched Lil' J's previous work.

```python
# Customize loss function

def custom_loss(output, labels, activate_one_hot):
    loss = nn.MSELoss()
    normal_loss = loss(output, labels)
    activate_loss = torch.sum((activate_one_hot * (output - labels)) ** 2)
    return normal_loss + activate_loss
```

Once he was satisfied with the tweaked model, he trained it again and generated a new instrumental that was perfect for Lil' J.

## Conclusion

And there you have it, folks. This is how machine learning can be employed in the world of music production. By training a model on a dataset of instrumentals, we can generate new, unique instrumentals that capture the essence of an artist's style. By tweaking the model according to an artist's preferences and requirements, we can get a custom instrumental that inspires and helps the artist create magic.
