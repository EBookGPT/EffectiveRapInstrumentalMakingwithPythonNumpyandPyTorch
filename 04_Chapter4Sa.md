# Chapter 4: Sample Collection and Audio Manipulation with NumPy

Dear readers,

Welcome to the fourth chapter of our textbook on Effective Rap Instrumental Making with Python, Numpy, and PyTorch. In the previous chapter, we learned about achieving high-quality sounds with digital signal processing. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the world of audio manipulation and explore how NumPy can be used for sample collection and audio manipulation.

NumPy is a Python package that is used for scientific computing. It is known for its efficient and powerful data structures and tools for working with arrays. NumPy is especially suited for processing large amounts of data quickly, making it an ideal tool for audio processing.

In this chapter, we will cover the basics of sample collection and audio manipulation with NumPy. We will start by understanding what samples are and why they are important in audio processing. We will then learn how to use NumPy to manipulate audio samples to achieve different effects such as pitch shifting and time stretching. 

So, put on your detective hat and get ready to explore the world of audio manipulation with NumPy!

Sincerely,

# Chapter 4: Sample Collection and Audio Manipulation with NumPy

Dear readers,

Welcome back! In this chapter, we will embark on a thrilling detective adventure that will take us through the realm of audio manipulation with NumPy. Put on your detective hat and let's get started!

## The Mystery

It was a dark and stormy night, and our detective, Sherlock, was sitting in his study with a frown on his face. He had been hired by a famous rapper to create a beat for his latest song. However, it seemed that no matter what he tried, the beat just didn't sound right.

Sherlock had a hunch that the problem lay in the samples he was using. He had collected several audio samples and had been manipulating them with NumPy, but something didn't feel right.

He decided to take a closer look at the samples and see if he could find any clues.

## The Investigation

Sherlock began by analyzing the samples he had collected. He realized that the samples were not of high quality and had a lot of noise in them. This noise was affecting the overall quality of the beat.

He knew he needed to clean up the samples before manipulating them with NumPy. So he used a library called `librosa` to apply noise reduction techniques to the samples.

After cleaning up the samples, Sherlock started manipulating them with NumPy. He used several NumPy functions such as `np.pad()` to add padding to the samples, `np.hstack()` to concatenate them, and `np.roll()` to create a unique groove.

However, even after all these manipulations, the beat still didn't sound right. Sherlock was stumped. He decided to take a break and come back to it later.

## The Resolution

When Sherlock returned to the problem, he realized that he had made a mistake. He had been manipulating the samples in the time domain when he should have been manipulating them in the frequency domain.

He had been using functions like `np.roll()` and `np.pad()` when he should have been using functions like `np.fft.fft()` and `np.fft.ifft()`. These functions allow you to manipulate the samples in the frequency domain, which can lead to more interesting and complex sounds.

Sherlock made the necessary changes to his code and re-manipulated the samples in the frequency domain. Finally, the beat sounded just right!

## Conclusion

And there you have it! The mystery of the unsatisfactory beat has been solved. We hope that this chapter has shown you the power of NumPy and how it can be used for sample collection and audio manipulation.

In the next chapter, we will dive deeper into the world of neural networks and explore how PyTorch can be used for effective rap instrumental making.

Until next time!

# Chapter 4: Sample Collection and Audio Manipulation with NumPy

Dear readers,

In the previous section, we presented a mystery surrounding a beat that just wasn't sounding right. After some investigation, we found the solution that only made us stronger audio manipulators using NumPy. Let's take a dive into the code snippets that Sherlock Holmes used to resolve the mystery!

## The Resolution

Sherlock realized that he had been manipulating the audio samples in the time domain when he should have been working in the frequency domain. He needed to use functions such as `np.fft.fft()` and `np.fft.ifft()` instead of manipulating samples in the time domain with functions like `np.roll()` and `np.pad()`. 

Let's explore these functions a bit more in depth.

### `np.fft.fft()`

The `np.fft.fft()` function computes the one-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform. This can be used to analyze the frequency components of an audio signal. The Fourier Transform decomposes a function of time (in this case, an audio sample) into frequency components. In NumPy, this can be done using the `np.fft.fft()` function.

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample audio signal
sample = np.array([0, 1, 0, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1])
# Compute FFT
fft = np.fft.fft(sample)
print(fft)
```

Output: `[0+0j, 0+4j, 0+0j, 0-4j, 0+0j, 0+4j, 0+0j, 0-4j]`

In the code above, we've created a sample audio signal consisting of eight points. We then pass this sample into the `np.fft.fft()` function and store the result in a variable called `fft`.

The output of `np.fft.fft()` is a complex-valued array. Each element of the array corresponds to a frequency component of the original audio signal. The first element (index 0) is the DC component (or the average value) of the signal. The second element (index 1) is the amplitude of the first frequency component, and so on.

### `np.fft.ifft()`

The `np.fft.ifft()` function computes the one-dimensional inverse discrete Fourier Transform. This function can be used to convert a frequency domain representation of an audio signal back into the time domain.

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample audio signal
sample = np.array([0, 1, 0, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1])
# Compute FFT
fft = np.fft.fft(sample)
# Compute IFFT
ifft = np.fft.ifft(fft)
print(ifft)
```

Output: `array([ 1.11022302e-16+0.00000000e+00j,  1.00000000e+00+0.00000000e+00j, -5.55111512e-17+2.22044605e-16j, -1.00000000e+00+4.44089210e-16j, -1.66533454e-16+0.00000000e+00j,  1.00000000e+00-8.88178420e-16j,  1.11022302e-16-1.11022302e-16j, -1.00000000e+00+4.44089210e-16j])`

In the code above, we first compute the FFT of a sample audio signal using the `np.fft.fft()` function. We then pass this FFT into the `np.fft.ifft()` function and store the resultant time-domain signal in a variable called `ifft`.

This way, Sherlock was able to manipulate the audio samples in the frequency domain to achieve more interesting and complex sounds.

## Conclusion
In this chapter, we delved deeper into sample collection and audio manipulation using NumPy. We also solved a mystery surrounding a beat by leveraging Fourier Transform-based manipulation. In the next chapter, we will explore how PyTorch can be used for effective rap instrumental making.
