# Chapter 6: Harmony, Melody and Chord Progressions with PyTorch

Welcome to the sixth chapter of our book about Effective Rap Instrumental Making with Python, Numpy, and PyTorch! In the previous chapter, we explored the world of rhythm construction using beat slicing and sequencing techniques. Now, we will dive into the realm of harmony, melody, and chord progressions using the powerful PyTorch library.

Harmony and melody are the building blocks of any great musical composition. In this chapter, we will learn how to create complex chord progressions and melodies using PyTorch's neural network capabilities. From basic triads to more advanced jazz chords, we'll show you how to generate unique and compelling chord progressions.

We'll also explore how to create catchy melodies that complement your chord progressions using simple waveform manipulation using Numpy. By the end of this chapter, you'll have the knowledge and tools to take your rap instrumental production to the next level.

So get ready to flex your musical creativity and let's get started with Harmony, Melody, and Chord Progressions with PyTorch!
# Chapter 6: Harmony, Melody and Chord Progressions with PyTorch

## The Case of the Missing Chords

Sherlock Holmes sat at his desk, staring at the sheet music on his computer screen. "Something's not right," he muttered. "The chords in this rap instrumental are all wrong."

"What's wrong with them, Holmes?" asked his trusty sidekick Dr. John Watson.

"I can't quite put my finger on it," replied Holmes. "But the chord progressions just don't sound like they belong together. It's almost as if they're...missing something."

Watson scratched his head. "Is there anything we can do?"

Holmes stood up and stretched. "Indeed there is. I've been experimenting with PyTorch, and I believe we can use it to generate harmonious chord progressions that are sure to impress."

Holmes fired up his computer and began coding in Python. He imported the PyTorch library and started training a neural network to generate chord progressions based on data he had input. After a few hours of tweaking and training, the network was ready.

"Now, Watson, let's hear what our new chords sound like," said Holmes with a smirk.

Watson listened as Holmes played a new chord progression generated by the neural network. It was beautiful. The chords flowed seamlessly together, creating the perfect backdrop for a rap artist to lay down their rhymes.

"Amazing, Holmes!" exclaimed Watson. "But how did you know PyTorch could help us solve the case of the missing chords?"

Holmes smiled. "It was all in the data, Watson. I analyzed the chord progressions of hundreds of hit rap songs, and found that they all shared certain patterns and rhythms. With PyTorch's ability to learn these patterns and generate new ones, we were able to create something truly special."

## Resolution

Thanks to PyTorch's powerful neural network capabilities, Holmes and Watson were able to generate beautiful and harmonious chord progressions that were a perfect fit for their rap instrumental. By analyzing data from popular rap songs, they were able to train the network to learn important patterns and generate new ones.

With the knowledge and tools from this chapter, you too can create stunning chord progressions and melodies that are sure to impress. Just remember to let the data guide you, and use PyTorch to bring your musical vision to life.
Sure! In our mystery, Sherlock Holmes used PyTorch to generate harmonious chord progressions for his rap instrumental. Let's dive into the code to see how he did it.

First, Holmes imported the PyTorch library and defined the neural network architecture. He decided to create a simple two-layer network with 128 hidden units in each layer. Here's what the code looks like:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ChordNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ChordNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(12, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 128)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(128, 12)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = torch.sigmoid(self.fc3(x))
        return x
```

Holmes then loaded his training data and split it into inputs (chords) and outputs (the next chord in the progression). He used the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function to train the network. Here's the code:

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

for epoch in range(1000):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = net(inputs)
    loss = criterion(output, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

Once the network was trained, Holmes generated new chord progressions by feeding in a starting chord and sampling from the output probabilities. Here's the code:

```python
start_chord = torch.tensor([0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0], dtype=torch.float32)
generated_chords = []
with torch.no_grad():
    for i in range(16):
        output = net(start_chord)
        output_prob = torch.softmax(output, dim=0)
        chord_ix = torch.multinomial(output_prob, 1)
        generated_chords.append(chord_ix)
        start_chord = output_prob

generated_chords = torch.stack(generated_chords).squeeze().numpy().tolist()
```

Finally, Holmes played the generated chord progression and was pleased with the results. By utilizing PyTorch's neural network capabilities and the power of data analysis, he was able to solve the case of the missing chords and create a beautiful new rap instrumental.

So there you have it! With PyTorch, you too can generate harmonious chord progressions and take your rap instrumental production to new heights.
